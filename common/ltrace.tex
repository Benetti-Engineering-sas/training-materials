  A tool to trace library calls used by a program and all the signals
  it receives
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Very useful complement to \code{strace}, which shows only system
    calls. Library calls include system calls too!
  \item Of course, works even if you don't have the sources
  \item Allows to filter library calls with regular expressions, or
    just by a list of function names.
  \item Also offers a summary with its \code{-c} option.
  \item Manual page: \url{https://linux.die.net/man/1/ltrace}
  \item Works better with {\em glibc}. \code{ltrace} was broken
        with {\em uClibc} and may still be.
  \end{itemize}
  See \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ltrace} for details
