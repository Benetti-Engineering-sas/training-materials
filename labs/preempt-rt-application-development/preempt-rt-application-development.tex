\subchapter{Lab3: Optimizing an application for Real-Time}{}

During this lab, you will:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Analyse the source code of an application
  \item Better understand the page-faulting mechanism
  \item Use ftrace to display the program's behaviour
\end{itemize}

\section{Compile and run the program}

Compile the pgflt program : \code{make}

Test the various options, and analyse how the Stack and Heap are allocated and
pre-faulted.

Use ftrace to visualise the page-fault occurings :
\begin{bashinput}
	trace-cmd record -e *page_fault* ./pgflt 0x1f
\end{bashinput}

This is a good example where kernelshark can be useful, try to export the trace
to your host machine for cold analysis.
