    \begin{itemize}
    \item Kernel developpers write {\em Device Tree Sources (DTS)},
      which become {\em Device Tree Blobs (DTB)} once compiled.
    \item There is one different Device Tree for each board/platform
      supported by the kernel, available in
      \code{arch/<arch>/boot/dts/<board>.dtb}. Their purpose is:
      \begin{columns}

        \begin{itemize}
        \item To describe external devices attached to non-discoverable
          busses and configure them.
        \item To configure pin muxing: choosing what SoC signals are
          made available on the board external connectors.
          See \url{http://linux.tanzilli.com/} for a web service doing this
          interactively.
        \item To configure some system parameters: flash partitions,
          kernel command line (other ways exist)
