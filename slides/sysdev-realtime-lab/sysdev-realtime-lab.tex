{Real-time - Scheduling latency}
{
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Check clock accuracy.
  \item Start processes with real-time priority.
  \item Build a real-time application against the standard POSIX
        real-time API, and against Xenomaiâ€™s POSIX skin
  \item Compare scheduling latency on your system, between a standard
        kernel, a kernel with PREEMPT\_RT and a kernel with Xenomai.
  \end{itemize}
